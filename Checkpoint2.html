            <p>
                The Tesla Roadster dropped into space last February, during the inaugural flight of the Falcon Heavy ,
                has now passed the Martian orbit . Representatives of SpaceX , the builder of this powerful launcher ,
                announced the news on Twitter on November 2, stating, diagram supporting the position of Starman. This
                mannequin disguised as an astronaut currently holds the wheel of the red racing car .

                Next stop on this epic road trip in space: "the last restaurant before the end of the world" jokes
                SpaceX, referring to the second installment of Douglas Adams' Galactic Traveler's Guide. Starman and
                his Tesla continue their course in an orbit that will remove them from Mars and bring them closer to
                Earth . This unusual NEO should be close to our planet in 2091. The probability of an impact is however
                minimal: 6% chance to crash over the next million years. So, to quote the quote - even the blink of an
                eye to the science fiction novel by Douglas Adams - specified on the dashboard of the spatial Tesla: "
                Do not panic ! " .

                <p>

                    is now
                    on the list of best surgeons of the world.
                    Dr. Mohamed Abul-Qasim Bourguiba, a Tunisian national and professor at the Faculty of Medicine
                    in
                    Tunis, worked in Section 21 of Charles Nicole Hospital, then moved to the private sector for
                    nearly a
                    year and a half.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I did a lot of scientific research during my work in the public and private sectors and all
                    the
                    research I did was related to my chosen specialty, laparoscopy," said the doctor.
                    Dr. Bourguiba added that during his career, he has conducted more than 15 scientific research
                    and
                    scientific articles published on international sites. He pointed out that his selection was not
                    easy,
                    as it was the subject of a thorough evaluation by the organization's Supervisory Committee,
                    which
                    lasted nearly three years.

                uncontrollable.
