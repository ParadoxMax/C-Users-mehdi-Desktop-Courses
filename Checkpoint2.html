                         The Tesla Roadster dropped into space last February, during the inaugural flight of the Falcon Heavy , has now passed the Martian orbit .

                         Next stop on this  epic road trip in space:  "the last restaurant before the end of the world" jokes SpaceX, referring to the second installment of Douglas Adams' Galactic Traveler's Guide. Starman and his Tesla continue their course in an orbit that will remove them from Mars and bring them closer to Earth . This unusual NEO should be close to our planet in 2091. The probability of an impact is however minimal: 6% chance to crash over the next million years. So, to quote the quote - even the blink of an eye to the science fiction novel by Douglas Adams - specified on the dashboard of the spatial Tesla: " Do not panic ! " .

                  Tunisian nominee team made a brilliant Application for NASA SPACEAPPS CHALLENGE 2018!
                 <p>
                     Team member Mehdi M'sallem  explained that The app features three main tabs :
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Alerts: our way to notify people of possible natural disasters, they are issued by local authorities and targeted towards users located in /near danger zones. we should note that a user's location can be set manually or by granting GPS access to the app.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Checklists: helps people coordinate their steps while they're stuck in dangerous situations. The default checklists for different disasters are also issued /regularly updated by local authorities to better accommodate different particularities of each region, However checklists are fully customizable so users can add their own checklist items to accommodate their own needs. Generally this tab contains information about appropriate preparations, Also when necessary: an escape plan, items to put in your evacuation go bag and coordinates of the safest places /assembly points
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Status: provides people with information about the disaster predicted in their geolocation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     "Don't be fooled with the minimalistic User Interface because, we are planning on running some pretty interesting stuff in the back. this app's pièce de résistance is the fact that it should be able to connect all users that have this app with a Bluetooth mesh network in case of cell coverage loss during disasters. That's very important for sharing newly issued alerts, assembly points and keeping users connected and up to date during and after the disaster.
                     It's also worth noting that our app rocks a responsive design that fits multiple screen sizes from the smallest phones to the biggest smart TV screens and very soon we'll support smart watches." said Mehdi Msallem
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     "Imagine one day that you could save your beloved ones by single screen tap, it's not just a matter of a competition or an award. It's a matter of human being, we could be heros and save millions of life. After all, everyone's life is precious" also added Mehdi.
